            <p>Tiger are one of the most popular animals in the world.But Sadly, they are all endangered to some point, and though conservation efforts are underway, they may not be fast enough. Even if enough tigers reproduce in captivity, they may not have anywhere to be released if humans continue taking their habitats and turning them into homes and shopping centers. The number one reason tigers are endangered to such a significant level is because of a lack of habitat and poaching.</p>
